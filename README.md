# Cowatiz

A simple Ionic / Cordova app using Firebase as backend

## Done :

  - User registration and authentication.
  - User picture upload and birth date saving.
  - Journey creation and deletion (sliding item on left)
  - Cities names are autocompleted thanks to a Google API.
  - Backend is using Firebase storage, database, and authentication APIs
  
## How to test it :
  
    git clone https://github.com/jkermes/cowatiz.git cowatiz
    cd cowatiz
    bower install
    cordova plugin install
    ionic serve --lab
